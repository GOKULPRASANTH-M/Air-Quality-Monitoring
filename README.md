# Air Quality Monitoring

Designed and implemented an IoT-based air quality monitoring system using environmental sensors to measure real-time atmospheric parameters such as gas concentration and air quality indices. The system acquires sensor data through embedded hardware, processes it to classify air quality levels and provides visual feedback to users for early identification of unhealthy environments. This project demonstrates the integration of sensing, data acquisition and real-time monitoring for smart environmental applications.
